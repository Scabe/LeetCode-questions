Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence 
while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string. 

Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

public class Solution {

    public String reverseWords(String s) {

        String[] words = s.split(" +");

        for(int i=0;i<words.length;i++){

            StringBuffer sb =new StringBuffer();

            sb.append(words[i]);

            words[i]=sb.reverse().toString();

        }

        return String.join(" ", words);

    }

}
