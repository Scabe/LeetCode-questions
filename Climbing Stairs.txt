You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer. 

//经典的递归问题，但是运行时间会超时，所以采取动态规划来提高效率

public class Solution {

    public int climbStairs(int n) {

        int a = 1;

        int b = 1;

        while(n-->0){

            b+=a;

            a=b-a;

        }

        return a;

    }

}
