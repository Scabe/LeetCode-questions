Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example:
Given a = 1 and b = 2, return 3. 



public class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while(b!=0){
            int res=a&b;
            a=a^b;
            b=res<<1;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
